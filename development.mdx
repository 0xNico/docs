## How Reflected Currencies are created

RDC's are created when users deposit into Reflect Protocol in order to hedge their liquid stake tokens (LSTs). The protocol accepts multiple LSTs as collateral and issues a single unified US Dollar denominated token (USDR) in return at a 1:1 cash value to the deposit.

### How Redeeming Reflected Currencies works
Redemption of RDC's is the exact reverse of the Deposit flow. Users will Burn (An onchain redemption mechanic) the equivalent amount of USDR (US Dollars Reflected) for the underlying amount of requested LST.

<Info>Redemption of USDR and the subsequent withdrawals of LSTs is an instant atomic process. *There is no wait period to receive collateral from the protocol.*</Info>
