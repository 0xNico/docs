## ReflectRMS (Aurora)
Aurora is an Autonomous Risk Monitoring Service (aRMS) with Generative Risk Scores that are algorithmically calculated and posted onchain. It is designed to systematically archive and index onchain data points that are relevant to the operational and economical security of the Reflect Delta-Neutral Protocol. 

### Bringing risk management onchain with Aurora.

Aurora v0 introduces a *first-in-industry* Autonomous Risk Monitoring Service for Delta-Neutral Protocols that is deeply integrated with its onchain program. 

The node collects tens of thousands of data points daily analysing these with complex risk scoring models that are then automatically posted onchain similar to how oracles post prices. Then the Reflect Program is able to react to the perceived risk to collateral with things like insurance claims without the need for governance.
