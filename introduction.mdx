Reflect is **pure DeFi** - built from the Validator upwards. It is a suite of financial primitives that enable anyone to create and redeem *digital reflections of international currencies.* Reflect at its core is a synthetic RWA protocol; however, it's built with *native yield* in mind. Let us explore.

    Staking on Solana involves locking up your SOL tokens to support the network's security and operations. In return for staking your tokens, you earn a native yield, which is a portion of the rewards generated by the network.
