## Introduction to Decentralized Yield Generation

Reflect Protocol builds on-top of the interest bearing 'Liquid Staking Token (LST)' primitive tied directly to **Proof of Stake Rewards, Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) and Priority Fees** generated by <ins>Validators.</ins>

Reflect Protocol deems this as - **Native Yield** and combines it with **Delta-Neutral Hedging** to remove Solana (SOL) volatility.

## What is Native Yield
Native Yield in an extended definition is Interest generated from the operation and economic security of the blockchain itself. Validators and Stakers earn a percentage of total network revenues diversified into different streams as outlined *below.*

    Staking on Solana involves locking up your SOL tokens to support the network's security and operations. In return for staking your tokens, you earn a native yield, which is a portion of the rewards generated by the network.

    By operating a Jito Network enabled client the Reflect Validator generates additional returns through the distribution of MEV tips paid by advanced onchain traders.

    Priority Fees are the additional lamports sent by transaction submitters as an incentive for inclusion within a block. Validators aim to make the most economically positive blocks within the bounds of their ordering system to generate additional yield.

## What is Delta-Neutral Hedging

RDC's are created when users deposit into Reflect Protocol in order to hedge their liquid stake tokens (LSTs). The protocol accepts multiple LSTs as collateral and issues a single unified US Dollar denominated token (USDR) in return at a 1:1 cash value to the deposit.

### How Redeeming Reflected Currencies works
Redemption of RDC's is the exact reverse of the Deposit flow. Users will Burn (An onchain redemption mechanic) the equivalent amount of USDR (US Dollars Reflected) for the underlying amount of requested LST.

<Info>Redemption of USDR and the subsequent withdrawals of LSTs is an instant atomic process. *There is no wait period to receive collateral from the protocol.*</Info>

## Using Reflected Currencies

Discover common use cases for **Reflected Currencies** below such as hedging your Solana assets to earn US Dollars (USD), or international payments in currencies such as Hong Kong Dollar (HKD).

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
<br/>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Are their any Mint/Redeem fees?">
    **No**, There are zero fees when minting or redeeming Reflected Currencies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="How is the price of Reflected Currencies stable?">
    Reflect Protocol operates what is known as a **Delta-Neutral trade** or in simpler terms, it is **hedging** your deposit with an equal size short of the same asset. This removes exposure to price risk and increases exposure to funding rates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Where does the Interest (yield) come from?">
    Interest is generated from two primary avenues and a multitude of others. These are **Staking Yields and Funding Rate Exposure.**

    The increased exposure to funding rates inherit from the creation of a Delta-Neutral position comes with a historically positive APY(%) paid by those seeking leverage on perpetuals.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Is the collateral in the protocol insured?">
    **Yes.** Reflect Protocol operates both a **hard cash insurance fund** and multiple **Restaked Validated Services** that *offloads* protocol risk to network stakers in exchange for a portion of revenue.
